## Overview

The Logs Explorer is your home base for troubleshooting and exploration with different types of insights from your log data scoped by a search filter.

A search filter consists of a timerange (`Past 5 minutes` in the example below) and a search query (`service:payment status:error rejected` in the example below). Refer to our [search syntax][1] documentation for all details on how to use full-text and faceted search.

## Live Queries

The Live Tail displays logs as they flow into Datadog. Live Tail logs do not persist, but the view provides visibility on **all** logs, whether they are indexed or not. Find out more in the [Log Live Tail section][2].

{{< img src="logs/explorer/log_explorer_walkthrough_livetail.gif" alt="Log Livetail" style="width:60%;" >}}

## Queries on Indexed Data

Navigate all [indexed logs][31] in the Log Explorer: filter and aggregate your logs and visualise the outcome of these queries.





### Aggregations and Measures

Logs can be valuable as individual events. However, the information valuable for troubleshooting or reporting resides on higher level entities aggregated from logs. With the Log Explorer, aggregate logs on-the-fly and derive consolidated information from there.

#### Simple Groups

With the simple group aggregation, all logs matching the query filter are aggregated into groups based on the value of that facet for logs. 

On top of these groups, you can extract the following measures:
* **count of logs** per group
* **unique count** of coded values for a facet
* **statistical operations** (min/max, avg and percentiles) on numerical values of a facet

Groups support the [Timeseries](#timeseries), [Toplist](#toplist) and [Table](#table) visualizations.

Note that individual logs having multiple values for a single facet would belong to that many groups. For instance, a log having the `team:sre` and the `team:marketplace` tags would be counted once in the `team:sre` group and once in the `team:marketplace` group.

#### Patterns

With pattern aggregation, logs having messages with similar structures are grouped altogether.

Patterns support the List visualisation.

#### Transactions

The Log Transactions automatically aggregate indexed logs according to instances of a **sequence** of events, such as a user session or a request processed across multiple micro-services. Find out more in the [Log Transactions section][5].

{{< img src="logs/explorer/log_explorer_walkthrough_transactions.png" alt="Log Transactions" style="width:60%;" >}}

Transaction support the [List](#lists) visualisation.

### Visualisations

The Log Analytics **graph** log queries and see maximums, averages, percentiles, unique counts, and more. Follow the [log graphing guide][6] to learn more about all the graphing options.

#### Lists

The Log List displays indexed logs and offers privileged tools to navigate **individual results**. Find out more in the [Log List section][3].


#### Timeseries

#### Toplists

#### Nested Tables




## The Log Side Panel

Datadog displays individual logs following this general side-panel layout:

{{< img src="logs/explorer/log_side_panel.png" alt="Log Side Panel"  style="width:60%;">}}

### Log structured information 

- The upper part of the panel displays general **context** information.
- The lower part of the panel displays the actual **content** of the log.

**Context** refers to the infrastructure and application context in which the log has been generated. Information is gathered from tags—whether automatically attached (host name, container name, log file name, serverless function name, etc.)—or added through custom tags (team in charge, environment, application version, etc.) on the log by the Datadog Agent or Log Forwarder.

**Content** refers to the log itself. This includes the log message, as well as all structured information extracted and enriched from the logs through [Log Pipelines][7]. For logs generated by common components of a technical stack, parsing and enriching comes out-of-the-box:

- For file log collection, make sure you properly set up the source field, which triggers file log collection. See Datadog's [100+ Log Integrations][8] for reference.
- For container log collection, use [Autodiscovery][9].

Some standard fields—for instance, `error.stack`, `http.method`, or `duration`—have specific enhanced displays in the Log Panel for better readability. Make sure you extract corresponding information from your logs and remap your attributes with [standard attribute remappers][10].

### A hub to other data sources

#### Correlation with Infrastructure (Host, Container, Serverless) data

The **View in context** button updates the search request in order to show you the log lines dated just before and after a selected log—even if they don't match your filter. This context is different according to the situation, as Datadog uses the `Hostname`, `Service`, `filename`, and `container_id` attributes, along with tags, in order find the appropriate context for your logs.

Click on the **Metrics Tab** and access underlying infrastructure metrics in a 30 minutes timeframe around the log.

Interact with **Host** in the upper reserved attributes section, the related [host dashboard][11] or [network page][12]. Interact with **Container** sections to jump to the [container page][13] scoped with the underlying parameters.

{{< img src="logs/explorer/log_side_panel_infra.gif" alt="Hub to Infra" style="width:60%;">}}

In case logs comes from a serverless source, the Host Section is replaced with a Serverless section that links jump to the corresponding [serverless page][14].

{{< img src="logs/explorer/log_side_panel_infra-serverless.png" alt="Hub to Serverless" style="width:60%;">}}


#### Correlation with APM data

Make sure you enable [trace injection in logs][15] and follow our [Unified Service Tagging][16] best practices to benefit from all the capabilities of Logs and APM correlation.

Click on the **APM Tab** and see the log in the context of its whole trace, with upstream and downstream services running. Deep dive in the APM data and the [trace in APM][17].

Interact with the **Service** section to refocus the search in the log explorer and see all other logs from the same trace.

{{< img src="logs/explorer/log_side_panel_infra.gif" alt="Hub to APM" style="width:60%;">}}


### Configure your troubleshooting context

Interact with the attributes names and values in the lower JSON section to:

- Add or remove a column from the logs table.
- Append the search request with specific values (include or exclude)

{{< img src="logs/explorer/side_panel_context.gif" alt="Side Panel context"  style="width:60%;">}}

- Build or edit a facet or measure from an attribute. See [Log Facets][18].

{{< img src="logs/explorer/side_panel_facets.gif" alt="Side Panel Facets"  style="width:60%;">}}

### Share a log

Use the **Share** button to share the log opened in side panel to other contexts.

- **Copy to clipboard** or `Ctrl+C` / `Cmd+C` copies the log JSON to your clipboard.
- **Share Event** shares the log (along with the underlying view) with teammates through email, Slack, and more. See all [Datadog notification integrations][19] available.

## Troubleshooting Context

### Search Filter


### Saved views

Use saved views to automatically configure your log explorer with a preselected set of facets, measures, searches, time ranges, and visualizations. Check the dedicated [saved views documentation][21] to learn more.

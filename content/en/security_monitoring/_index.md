## Overview

Datadog Security Monitoring unifies the developers, operations, and security teams into one platform. A single dashboard displays devops content, business metrics, and security content.

Datadog Compliance Monitoring enables runtime security and continuous compliance monitoring for containers and hosts.

{{< img src="compliance_monitoring/compliance-overview.png" alt="Datadog Compliance Monitoring" >}}

Use **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** to watch for changes to key files and directories on hosts or containers in real time or **Continuous Compliance** checks against your containers, and Kubernetes clusters in order to find configuration issues, as defined in the popular CIS compliance benchmarks for Docker and Kubernetes. You can choose to enable either of these features (or both) based on your needs.

Datadog detects threats out-of-the-box and can notify your team of security issues by email, Slack, Jira, PagerDuty, or a webhook.

Datadog detects many different sorts of threats to your application or infrastructure. A few examples include a targeted attack, an IP communicating with your systems which matches a threat intel list, or an insecure configuration. These threats are surfaced in Datadog as Security Signals and can be correlated and triaged in the [Security Signals Explorer][1].

Security Signals are generated by Datadog Security Monitoring with [Detection Rules][2]. Detection Rules detect threats across different sources and are available out of the box for immediate use. Any of the provided detection rules can be cloned to change the configuration. A [new rule][3] can also be created from scratch.

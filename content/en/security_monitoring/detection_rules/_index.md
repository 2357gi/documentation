## Overview

Detection Rules define conditional logic that is applied to all ingested logs and cloud configurations. When at least one case defined in a rule is matched over a given period of time, Datadog generates a Security Signal.

Security Monitoring uses Log Detection to analyze ingested logs in real time. Compliance Monitoring uses Cloud Configuration to scan the state of your cloud environment. For each monitoring option, there are [default detection rules][1] that work out-of-the-box with integration configuration. You can also create new rules to tailor to your environment.

## Creating and Managing Rules

The [Security Configuration Rules][2] page lets you search all Detection Rules. Quickly enable, disable, edit, delete, clone, or view signals generated by any of these rules. To create a new [security][3] or [compliance][4] monitoring rule, click on the **New Rule** button in the top right corner of the page.

### Finding rules

The free text search filters Detection Rules by text in the rule name or query. Query results update in real time when the query is edited—there is no “Search” button to click.

### Rules table

Rules are displayed in the rules table.

Configure the rules table content and preferences with the Options button. Only date created and rule ID are available for additional columns.

Rules are sorted alphabetically—ascending by default (A-Z). The rules can be inverse-sorted by name, as well as sort by query name, creation date, or rule ID.

#### Enabling or disabling a rule

Enable or disable a rule using the toggle switch to the right of the rule.

#### Editing a rule

Edit a rule by hovering over the rule and clicking the **Edit** button.

#### Searching for signals generated by a rule

Search for signals generated by a rule by hovering over the rule and clicking the **View Generated Signals** button.

#### Cloning a rule

Clone a rule by hovering over the rule and clicking the **Clone** button.

#### Deleting a rule

Delete a rule by hovering over the rule and clicking the **Delete** button.

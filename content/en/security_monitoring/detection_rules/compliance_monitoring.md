## Create a New Rule

To create a new rule in Datadog, hover over **Security**, select **Security Rules**, and select the **New Rule** button in the top right corner of the page.

### Select a rule type

For Compliance Monitoring, select **Cloud Configuration** to scan the state of your cloud environment.

### Detection method

#### Threshold

Define when events exceed a user-defined threshold. For example, if you create a trigger with a threshold of `>10`, a security signal occurs when the condition is met.

### Define the configuration query

The configuration query is automatically configured and grouped by `resource_type` and `resource_id`. For example, if you are using the [AWS Cloudtrail][1] integration, all security signals are automatically tagged and populated based on that integration. There are also default rules available based on [cloud configuration][2].

Set a custom severity and notification for all rules, as detailed below, or use a default rule for better control over individual cloud configurations.

### Set severity and notifications

Set the severity of the Security Signal. The dropdown allows you to select an appropriate severity level (`INFO`, `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`).

In the “Notify” section, configure zero or more [notification targets][3] for each rule case.

### Say what's happening

The notification box has the same Markdown and preview features as those of [monitor notifications][4].

Tag your signals with different tags, for example `security:attack` or `technique:T1110-brute-force`.

**Note**: The tag `security` is special. This tag is used to classify the security signal. The recommended options are: `attack`, `threat-intel`, `compliance`, `anomaly`, and `data-leak`.

## Manage Rules

The [Security Configuration Detection Rules][2] page lets you search all Detection Rules. Quickly enable, disable, edit, delete, clone, or view signals generated by any of these rules. Create a [new rule][3] from scratch from this view.

### Finding rules

The free text search filters Detection Rules by text in the rule name or query. Query results update in real time when the query is edited—there is no “Search” button to click.

### Rules table

Rules are displayed in the rules table.

Configure the rules table content and preferences with the Options button. Only date created and rule ID are available for additional columns.

Rules are sorted alphabetically—ascending by default (A-Z). The rules can be inverse-sorted by name, as well as sort by query name, creation date, or rule ID.

#### Enabling or disabling a rule

Enable or disable a rule using the toggle switch to the right of the rule.

#### Editing a rule

Edit a rule by hovering over the rule and clicking the **Edit** button.

#### Searching for signals generated by a rule

Search for signals generated by a rule by hovering over the rule and clicking the **View Generated Signals** button.

#### Cloning a rule

Clone a rule by hovering over the rule and clicking the **Clone** button.

#### Deleting a rule

Delete a rule by hovering over the rule and clicking the **Delete** button.
